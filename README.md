Tutorials for mapping the definition of a finite state automaton to python code

There are three sets of tutorials: one for finite state machines/automata, one for recursive descent parsing, and one for relational algebra.

## Finite State Machines/Automata Tutorials
  * Begin with the FSA_code_example.ipynb notebook to see an example of implementing an FSA in Python
  * Then move to Multiple_FSAs_using_inheritance.ipynb notebook to see an example of how to create multiple FSAs that inherit from the same base class.
  * Finally, look at the FSA_list_managed_by_FSM to see one possible way to implement a way to manage all the FSAs required for project 1
