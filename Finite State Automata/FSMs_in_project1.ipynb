    "Second, let's discuss the notation for the transitions. The input set $I$ is the set of all legal characters. A symbol inside the quotation marks means that the transition occurs if that single character is seen. Thus, ':' means transition from state $s_0$ to state $s_1$ when the colon character is read. When the input set symbol $I$ is used on a transition (see the self loop on state $s_{\\rm err}$) it means the transition occurs for any input character. Finally, when the transition is labeled with $I-\\{c\\}$ it means the transition occurs for any character in the set produced by the set difference operator. In other words, the transition occurs on any character except the $c$. For example, $I-\\{':'\\}$ means the transition occurs on any character except the colon charater.\n",
