    "Each output can be collected into some sort of list, and that list is the input to a finite state machine (FSM) that decides which token is output. Notice how the arrows on the FSM on the right have two components: an input, which is the list represented by the sequence of true/false values in the square brackets, and an output, which is the token. The input and output are separated by a comma, which is how the textbook differentiates between the input and output in the FSMs it draws.\n",

    "The way this FSM operates is that it reads the list of true/false values and outputs the correct token. The top loop in the FSM says that the FSA for the left parenthesis succeeded and all others failed [TFFF], so the output should be the LEFT_PAREN token. The bottom right loop says that both the colon and colon-dash FSAs succeeded [FFTT], so the output should be the COLON-DASH token."
